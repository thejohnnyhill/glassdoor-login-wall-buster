# Glassdoor Login Wall Buster

This is a Boost for the [Arc browser](https://arc.net/) that allows you to **browse Glassdoor reviews fully and freely, without having to log in**. No more login prompts interrupting your job search, or "show more" teasers that force you to sign in to read the full reviews.

It's pure CSS, so can also be used as a standalone userstyle in plugins like [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html).


## Installation Instructions

- In Arc, click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the sidebar, and click "New Boost"
- Click the "Code {}" button
- Copy and paste the contents of the **style.css** file in this repository into the CSS tab of the code editor
- Rename the boost "Glassdoor Login Wall Buster" (or whatever you want, really, it's your browser)
- Done!
